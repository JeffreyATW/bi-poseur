  <div class="container">
    <p>Paolo thinks he's going to die. And not just quietly in his sleep when he's 87 either. He's convinced that the blood clot in his leg is going to make its way into his chest, causing a major heart attack, which would kill Paolo instantly at his desk, while he was updating his status on Facebook. And this is all assuming that Paolo doesn't kill himself first. Either by finally manning up and slitting his wrists (just making sure to avoid the tendons to retain use of his hands if he screws up) or maybe jumping in front of a BART train (although he doesn't wanna be remembered as the ass who got the trains delayed). But first, he has to write the perfect suicide note, which he can't seem to do.</p>
    <p class="description__pills">If you don't think that's dark enough, today is the day his mom died, fourteen years ago. Paolo's going to visit her grave, to sort out all this cosmic screwing around. From psych wards, to exclusive prep schools in Marin County, to Playstation controllers used as improvised nooses, what's someone who might be bi-polar to do?</p> 
    <p>Bi-Poseur, the show that Hiya Swanhuyser of the SF Weekly said “mines the depths and comes up with gold”, is probably the best time anyone will ever have hearing about suicide, mental illness, and dead parents for a night.</p>

    <p>Paolo Sambrano (Writer/Performer) Paolo Sambrano teeters on the edge of eye-rolling-never-ending-hyphenate and someone who actually does things. Creator of the Tumblr read by ten's of people, You Can't Hire Me. Paolo's debut solo show "Bi-Poseur" (directed by W. Kamau Bell, star of FX's Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell) has played to sold-out houses in the Bay Area, and has performed in Texas and Maryland. Paolo is a former sometimes purveyor of fine dried beef, was a speaker at South by Southwest Interactive, and also blogs about television at the San Francisco Appeal. Paolo has been featured in the SF Weekly, the San Francisco Chronicle, and Kxan-TV in Austin, TX mentioned that his suicide attempt was "obviously unsuccessful."</p>

      <h2>W. Kamau Bell</h2>
      <h3>Director</h3>
      <p>Socio-political comedian W. Kamau Bell has emerged as the post-modern voice of comedy. Kamau was recently named an Ambassador of Racial Justice by the ACLU. And he sits on the advisory board of Race Forward, a racial justice think tank and home for media and activism, and Hollaback, a non-profit and movement to end street harassment. Kamau is best known for his critically acclaimed, but criminally short-lived FX comedy series, Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell. The New York Times called Kamau “the most promising new talent in political comedy in many years.” And Salon.com listed Kamau on their “Sexiest Men of 2012” list, calling the series “surreptitiously revolutionary in its effortless diversity and humanism.” The New Yorker said, “Bell’s gimmick is intersectional progressivism: he treats racial, gay, and women’s issues as inseparable.” The San Francisco Chronicle raved, “it makes The Daily Show seem like something your dad watches.” In its brief time Totally Biased was nominated for both an NAACP Image Award and a GLAAD Award. Totally Biased was executive produced by Chris Rock, who became a fan after seeing a performance of Kamau’s one man show.</p>

      <p>"Comedy about suicide is so rare. Oh, sure, you’ve got your jokers in the comments on SFGate, but they’re not funny. Paolo Sambrano brings it, though. ...Sambrano mines the depths and comes up with gold in Bi-Poseur, a one-man show focusing on 'the quest for the perfect suicide note (otherwise, why do it?)' among other things."</p>
